The objective of the L2M3 workshop is to scope the requirements, possibilities of large language models (LLMs, and similar "foundation models") for the chemical and materials science. 

We want to: 

1. Understand the current state of the art in LLMs and their applications in chemistry and materials science.
2. Identify challenges, including ethical, legal, and social implications, and potential solutions.
3. Explore the post promising research directions and opportunities for steering the development of models and systems (e.g. via funding, benchmarks, datasets, organizational measures)
